I just got back from an awesome trip to Truckhaven and Ocotillo Wells with the [Santa Barbara 4-Wheel Drive Club](https://www.santabarbara4wdclub.com/). I love this area and we had a lot of fun to exploring the area, up and down hills and through tight washes in the mud.  This area area has some of my favorite kind of terrain to drive.  It has obstacles for everybody and vehicle -- first-timers to experienced offroaders -- and great place to learn to be a better driver.

One of the highlights was driving to the top of phone book hill for the first time. The view from up there was amazing, and looks like the maintainers recently installed a new phone booth. We got some videos to share as well below;
