As I write this I am prepping a Home Chef recipe -- [Cheesy Baked Spinach Rigatoni with Garlic Bread](IMG_4421.jpg).  The water is boiling for pasta, fresh spinach diced, and waiting for oven to preheat.  We initially started Home Chef in July 2020 -- during COVID -- to help minimize the trips to grocery store. The strategy has been my wife manages the menu for what we get each week, and I usually cook.  We typically order 2-4 meals a week, skipping the Holiday weeks and other weeks we were out of town of course.  According to the website, we have cooked approximately 380+ meals since starting.  We have no plans to cancel the subscription, have enjoyed the food each week, and I've enjoyed learning to cook better.

Here's a video of some Home Chef meals we had from 2022.  I have started to take more pictures while in the kitchen, and hope to share more with you in the future.
